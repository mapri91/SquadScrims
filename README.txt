# squadscrims
Discord bot for competitive matchmaking

// The idea behind this bot //

The idea is to make scrims easier to find, plan and manage. As Squad is getting more and more popular at the same time, more competitive teams are founded. To keep the competitive level high, I think we must reorganize the way how we look for scrims. As a clan rep I often have felt that the traditional way of searching for scrims takes a lot of time. You need to go to any discord servers, find out the clan-rep and discuss the match details. Another way is to spam tournament discord servers with messages like "Looking for scrim on date X, time Y, map Z". Both ways aren't quite modern.

What features are currently in?

- Team creation and automatic clan-rep role allocation
- You can create and join matches via the #match-browser 
- You can lock and unlock matches (to avoid people joining once the maximum number of players is reached)
- You can close the match, when it's finished or when you want to cancel it

What features are planned or under development?

- Filter function in the match browser (e.g. filter for specific map or match date)
- Thread creation within the match lobbys (so each side of the match has an internal chat)
- Role system within the match lobbys (give a specific role to each side of the match, check for player numbers)
